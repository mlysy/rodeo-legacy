# **probDE:** A Probabilistic Numerical Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations

*Mohan Wu, Martin Lysy*

---

## Description

**probDE** is a Python library that uses [probabilistic numerics](http://probabilistic-numerics.org/) to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs).  That is, most ODE solvers (such as [Euler's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method)) produce a deterministic approximation to the ODE on a grid of size `delta`.  As `delta` goes to zero, the approximation converges to the true ODE solution.  Probabilistic solvers such as **probDE** also output a solution an a grid of size `delta`; however, the solution is random.  Still, as `delta` goes to zero, the probabilistic numerical approximation converges to the true solution.

Currently, **probDE** implements the probabilistic solver of [Chkrebtii et al (2016)](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ba/1473276259).  This begins by putting a [Gaussian process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_process) prior on the ODE solution, and updating it sequentially as the solver steps through the grid.

## Installation

Download the repo from GitHub and then install with the `setup.py` script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mlysy/probDE.git
cd probDE
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

Please see the detailed example in the tutorial [here](probDE/Examples/tutorial.ipynb).  Running the tutorial compares the deterministic Euler solver to the probabilistic solver for the ODE initial value problem

```
x_t^{(2)} = sin(2t) - x_t^{(0)}
x_0^{(1)} = 0
x_0^{(0)} = -1
```

The results for N = 50, 100, and 200 grid points for both solvers is shown below.

## TODO

The **probDE** library is still in its early development stages, with a number of improvements projected for the not-so-distant future:

- Convert the code base to [Cython](https://cython.org/) to achieve two orders of magnitude in computational accelerations.
- Add multivariate ODE support.
- Implement a few more related probabilistic solvers; namely, those of [Kersting & Hennig (2016)](http://www.auai.org/uai2016/proceedings/papers/163.pdf) and [Schober et al (2019)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11222-017-9798-7.pdf).
