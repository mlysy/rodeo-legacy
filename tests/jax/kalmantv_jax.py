r"""
This module implements the Kalman Filter and Smoothing algorithms. The methods of the object can predict, update, sample and 
smooth the mean and variance of the Kalman Filter. This method is useful if one wants to track 
an object with streaming observations.

The specific model we are using to approximate the solution :math:`x_n` is

.. math::

    x_n = Q(x_{n-1} -\lambda) + \lambda + R_n^{1/2} \epsilon_n

    y_n = d + W x_n + \Sigma_n^{1/2} \eta_n

where :math:`\epsilon_n` and :math:`\eta_n` are independent :math:`N(0,1)` distributions and
:math:`y_n` denotes the model interrogation (observation) at time n.

The variables of the model are defined below in the argument section. The methods of this class
calculates :math:`\theta = (\mu, \Sigma)` for :math:`x_n` and the notation for
the state at time n given observations from k is given by :math:`\theta_{n|K}`.

Notes:
    - For best performance, all input arrrays should have contiguous memory in fortran-order.
    - Avoids memory allocation whenever possible.  One place this does not happen is in calculations of `A += B C`.  This is done with `A += np.dot(B, C)`, which involves malloc before the addition.
