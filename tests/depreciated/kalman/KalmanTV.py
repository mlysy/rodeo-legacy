class KalmanTV(object):
    """
    Create a Kalman Time-Varying object. The methods of the object can predict, update, sample and 
    smooth the mean and variance of the Kalman Filter. This method is useful if one wants to track 
    an object with streaming observations.

    The specific model we are using to track streaming observations is

    .. math::

        X_n = c + T X_n-1 + R_n^{1/2} \epsilon_n

        y_n = d + W x_n + H_n^{1/2} \eta_n

    where :math:`\epsilon_n` and :math:`\eta_n` are independent :math:`N(0,1)` distributions and
    :math:`X_n` denotes the state of the Kalman Filter at time n and :math:`y_n` denotes the 
    observation at time n.

    The variables of the model are defined below in the argument section. The methods of this class
    calculates :math:`\\theta = (\mu, \Sigma)` for :math:`X_n` and the notation for
    the state at time n given observations from k is given by :math:`\\theta_{n|K}`.
